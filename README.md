# Remix of Value Cards Study_V2 [VC]

Build me a web-based values card negotiation game called 

"Value Cards" using React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS.

This is a research/educational tool that replicates a 

physical card-trading exercise online. Players are dealt 

random value cards, pick their favorites, negotiate to 

trade for cards they want more, and reflect afterward.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

TECH REQUIREMENTS

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- React + TypeScript

- Tailwind CSS for styling

- No backend needed for v1 (all state local)

- Mobile responsive

- Export debrief data as JSON at the end

  (for research data collection)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

VISUAL DESIGN DIRECTION

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- Dark background (#0a0a0a or deep navy)

- Cards are physical-feeling: rounded corners, 

  slight shadow, cream/white face

- Value name in bold serif font (large)

- Definition in smaller sans-serif below

- Selected/starred cards glow amber/gold

- NPC cards shown in a different color zone 

  (cool blue tones vs player warm tones)

- Clean, minimal, no clutter

- Smooth transitions between phases

- Progress indicator at top (Phase 1 of 5 etc.)

COMPLETE SCREEN-BY-SCREEN SPEC

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

─── SCREEN 0: MODE SELECT ───────────────────────

Header: "Value Cards"

Subheader: "A negotiation game about what matters"

Two large cards to click:

[Solo]

"Play against an NPC partner"

"Good for: exploring your values alone"

[With Someone]  

"Share a code with a real person"

"Good for: live negotiations"

(Note: in v1 this can show "coming soon" 

or use a simple room-code system)

Below: deck size toggle

○ 18 cards (standard)  ○ 24 cards (extended)

─── SCREEN 1: GLOSSARY ──────────────────────────

Title: "The Values at Play"

Subtitle: "You'll be working with these 

           [18/24] values today."

Show all values as small cards in a grid

Each card: bold name + definition

Cards are NOT interactive here — 

just reference

"Take a moment to read these.

 You'll be dealt some at random shortly."

Button: "I'm ready →"

─── SCREEN 2: DEAL ──────────────────────────────

Animate cards being "dealt" one by one

Player receives 6 cards (18-deck) 

or 8 cards (24-deck)

Title: "Your hand"

Show cards face-up in a fan or grid

Each card: name (large) + definition (small)

Below cards:

"These values have been randomly dealt to you.

 Take a moment to sit with them."

Button: "Continue →"

─── SCREEN 3: PRIORITIZE ────────────────────────

Title: "Which matter most to you?"

Subtitle: "Select your top 2"

Show same hand of cards

Clicking a card toggles a gold star/glow

Enforce max 2 selections

If player tries to select 3rd: 

  subtle shake animation + 

  "You can only pick 2 — 

   deselect one first"

Show counter: "0/2 selected"

Below selected cards:

Optional text field:

"Why these two? (optional)"

placeholder: "What makes these feel 

              most like you?"

Button disabled until 2 selected: 

"Lock in my top 2 →"

─── SCREEN 4: WANT ──────────────────────────────

Split screen or two sections:

TOP SECTION:

"Your hand" — show all 6/8 cards

  (top 2 glowing gold)

BOTTOM SECTION:

Title: "Cards you weren't dealt"

Show remaining values NOT in player hand

as smaller, slightly greyed cards

Instruction: 

"Pick up to 2 values you'd want 

 to trade for"

Player selects 1-2 from the 

cards-not-in-hand list

Then a required text field appears:

"Why do you want [selected value]?"

placeholder: "What draws you to this one?"

Button: "See who you're trading with →"

─── SCREEN 5: MEET YOUR PARTNER ─────────────────

If NPC mode:

  Reveal NPC with animation

  

  "[Avatar emoji]  Meet [Name]"

  "[Description line]"

  

  "They've been dealt their own hand..."

  

  Show NPC hand face-down as card backs

  

  "They also have values they're 

   holding onto — and some they want."

  

  Button: "Start negotiating →"

─── SCREEN 6: NEGOTIATE ─────────────────────────

This is the most complex screen.

Use a two-panel layout:

LEFT PANEL — YOUR SIDE:

  "Your hand"

  Cards shown (top 2 glowing)

  "You want: [wanted card name]"

RIGHT PANEL — PARTNER'S SIDE:

  "[NPC Name]'s hand" 

  Show NPC cards face-up now

  (NPC top 2 glowing in blue)

  "They want: [NPC wanted card]"

CENTER — NEGOTIATION ZONE:

  

  Round indicator: "Round 1 of 3"

  

  NPC SPEAKS FIRST:

  Speech bubble from NPC:

  "[Dynamic dialogue based on 

   NPC type and what player wants]"

  

  e.g. if player wants Justice 

  and NPC is Alex (Idealist):

  "You want Justice? That's one 

   I hold closely. Tell me — 

   what are you offering, and why 

   should I part with it?"

  

  PLAYER RESPONSE AREA:

  "Offer a card from your hand:"

  [clickable cards from player hand]

  

  "Make your case:" (required)

  [text input]

  placeholder: "Why should they 

                trade with you?"

  

  Button: "Make this offer →"

  

  After player submits:

  NPC evaluates based on this logic:

  

  function evaluateOffer(

    offeredCard: Value,

    npc: NPCType,

    round: number

  ): "accept" | "decline" | "counter" | "refuse" {

    if (npc.coreValues.includes(offeredCard.name)) {

      return "refuse"

    }

    if (npc.flexValues.includes(offeredCard.name)) {

      return "accept"  

    }

    if (round >= 2) {

      return "counter"

    }

    return "decline"

  }

  

  NPC responds with appropriate 

  dialogue from their responses object

  

  Substitute {offeredCard}, {counterCard}, 

  {wantedCard} dynamically in dialogue strings

  

  If "counter": NPC offers an alternative

  card from their flex values

  Player can accept counter or try again

  

  Max 3 rounds then force resolution

  If no deal after 3 rounds: 

  outcome = "failed"

  

  Show outcome clearly:

  ✅ "Deal reached"

  🤝 "Partial deal" (counter accepted)

  ❌ "No deal reached"

─── SCREEN 7: RESOLUTION ────────────────────────

Title: "The Trade"

Side-by-side comparison:

YOUR HAND                 │ [NPC NAME]'S HAND

─────────────────────────────────────────────

Before:                   │ Before:

[all 6 starting cards]    │ [all 6 npc cards]

                          │

After:                    │ After:

[final cards with         │ [final cards]

 traded ones marked]      │

                          │

Lost: [card name]  →→→   │ Gained: [card name]

Gained: ←←← [card name]  │ Lost: [card name]

If no deal:

"You kept your original hand.

 So did [NPC Name]."

 

Brief NPC closing remark 

(one line, based on outcome)

Button: "Reflect on what happened →"

─── SCREEN 8: DEBRIEF ───────────────────────────

Title: "Reflect"

Subtitle: "The conversation matters 

           as much as the cards."

6 questions — all required:

Q1: "Which card was hardest to give up?"

    [dropdown of player's original hand]

Q2: "Why was it hard to let go of?"

    [text area]

Q3: "Did the negotiation change what 

     you wanted or valued?"

    ○ Yes  ○ No

    "What shifted for you?"

    [text area]

Q5: "What did you learn about your 

     partner's values?"

    [text area]

Q6: "Was there any hidden common ground 

     you didn't expect?"

    [text area]

Button: "See your summary →"

─── SCREEN 9: SUMMARY + EXPORT ──────────────────

Visual summary card:

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. NO case study content yet — 

   player plays as themselves, 

   not as a character

2. "Real player" mode on Mode Select 

   screen can say "Multiplayer — 

   coming soon" and be disabled 

   for now. Just build solo NPC mode.

3. The NPC never "wins" or "loses" — 

   this is not a competition. 

   Avoid any scoring language.

   The outcome is about 

   "understanding reached" not points.

4. Justification text fields are 

   REQUIRED in Phase 3 (want) 

   and Phase 6 (negotiate). 

   Don't allow skipping them.

5. The debrief is NOT optional. 

   No skip button. 

   All 6 questions required.

6. Keep all text warm and 

   conversational — not clinical.

   This is a reflective experience, 

   not a test.

7. On mobile: stack the two-panel 

   negotiate screen vertically 

   (player on top, NPC below)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

START BY BUILDING:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. The ValueCard component and 

   the ALL_VALUES data file

2. The ModeSelect screen

3. The Glossary screen

4. The Deal screen with animation

5. Wire all screens together 

   with useGameState hook

6. Then build Negotiate screen last 

   as it's the most complex
